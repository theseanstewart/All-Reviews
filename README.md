All Reviews
=================

All Reviews allows you to display all reviews of your products on a single CMS page. Customers searching Google, Bing, Yahoo for "YOUR STORE Reviews" will be able to find a page controlled by you with recent reviews of your products.

You can see it in action here: http://www.cornerstonejewelrydesigns.com/reviews

Instructions
=================

After you install the module, go to System > Configuration > EKO Internet Marketing > All Reviews. Click the General tab to expand it.

Now you need to configure the module. The default settings will work fine, but you can customize the way your reviews display by changing the different options

We recommend you keep the number of reviews under 50 to keep prevent long loading times

Once you're happy with the settings, go to CMS > Pages and create a new page. You can call it whatever you want, but we suggest using "Reviews" as the Page Title, and "reviews" as the URL Key.

On the content tab, paste the following code to display the reviews:

{{block type="allreviews/allreviews" name="all_reviews" template="allreviews/reviews.phtml"}}

After you've done that, visit yoursite.com/reviews and you should see reviews!
